***A Little About Me...***<br>
I started my coding journey in March 2022 at [TrueCoders](https://truecoders.io/) and received my certificate of completion in July 2022.<br>
Prior to becoming a Software Developer, I have been a stay-at-home parent for 5 years to both of my children, Audrey and Benjamin. I'm married to my best friend, who also turned me on to the coding world. My husband graduated from TrueCoders earlier this year and has been working as a developer for a company in Huntsville. He has been the best help and most supportive partner while I was going through the Software Development program.<br> I have accepted a position with TrueCoders as a Teaching Assistant as of October 2022. I now get to help students learn to develop their own projects and find a new love for software development! I'm so happy to be doing something I'm not only passionate about, but I get to be a part of an awesome team and work every day from the comfort of my home!<br>
